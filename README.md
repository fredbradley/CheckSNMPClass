# CheckSNMPClass
Version 1.1

A custom wrapper class is used to display information about [our](https://github.com/cranleighschool) UPS's on our [Nagdash](https://github.com/lozzd/Nagdash) board.

## Description
The point of a wrapper class is to be able to use it in multiple places, for multiple purposes. Allowing you to write good code once, and reuse it. 

The purpose of this code allows us to create blocks on our Nagios Dashboard that show us the health of a bunch of our UPS hardware.

## Example
To give you an idea of how it looks on our board...

alt="Example Screen Shot" width="200" height="200" border="10" style="float:left;" /></a>

However bare in mind this display is modified with CSS which is not covered in the scope of this GitHub repo.
